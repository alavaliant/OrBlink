An open source USB controlled RGB LED designed to go inside a small
plastic orb. Allows you to control the LED to any color meaning
you can indicate whatever you can imagine from a computer or other
USB host device.

Features:

 * Acts as a human interface device (HID) meaning it doesn't
   need drivers on Linux, Mac or Windows.
 * Based on the Atmel ATTiny85 like many other similar projects so
   you can use the firmware of your choice.
 * Supplied with example code for multiple operating systems.
